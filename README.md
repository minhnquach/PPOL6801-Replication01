> __Abstract:__
> There has been growing concern about the role social media playsin political polarization. We investigated whether out-group ani-mosity was particularly successful at generating engagement ontwo of the largest social media platforms: Facebook and Twitter.Analyzing posts from news media accounts and US congressionalmembers (n=2,730,215), we found that posts about the politicalout-group were shared or retweeted about twice as often as postsabout the in-group. Each individual term referring to the politicalout-group increased the odds of a social media post being sharedby 67%. Out-group language consistently emerged as the stron-gest predictor of shares and retweets: the average effect size ofout-group language was about 4.8 times as strong as that of neg-ative affect language and about 6.7 times as strong as that ofmoral-emotional language—both established predictors of socialmedia engagement. Language about the out-group was a verystrong predictor of“angry”reactions (the most popular reactionsacross all datasets), and language about the in-group was a strongpredictor of“love”reactions, reflecting in-group favoritism andout-group derogation. This out-group effect was not moderatedby political orientation or social media platform, but stronger ef-fects were found among political leaders than among news mediaaccounts. In sum, out-group language is the strongest predictor ofsocial media engagement across all relevant predictors measured,suggesting that social media may be creating perverse incentivesfor content expressing out-group animosity.
